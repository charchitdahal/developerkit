# developerkit

 We're excited to announce the developerkit, a new platform that provides developers with development tools at a low or no cost. The developerkit will be customized for each school, with students working on real-world tools and applying their knowledge in class. We've already launched pilot programs with partners like Kaggle and are opening registration starting now!
